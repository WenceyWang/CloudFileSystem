# CloudFileSystem

I got slept for a while and then dreamed that people are tapping me. I think she is Mizunara, my previous girlfriend who slept very light. So I reached out to hug her. Then I awakened from the dream that she had never betrayed and then left me alone.

Thus I think we should make a filesystem to store something kira-kira into the cloud instead of our brain. Just like I should not still miss her but I can not stop doing so.

And I am still wondering what is finally valuable and should be the value of me.

Thank you for reading this and wish this filesystem can help you.
